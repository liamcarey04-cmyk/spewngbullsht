        <h2>LOOSEIN-G,EARNING LEARNING NO-THINGS</h2></h2>
        <time>October 20, 2025</time>
        <p> 
			It has been 23 days since I have uploaded to this site. I dont like the way this site looks. I dont know what to do with all these things and ideas and whatevers. I made leroy helmet. I smashed leroy helmet. No worries I can repair it, if I ever get up. I have been depressed and unmotivated, yet I have many shotty ideas. I dont usually write them down, unfortunately. I dont know what The Hellps best song is. I dont care about Fakemink and nettspend beef, I just like thier songs. Does anyone see me? I am lonely. I dont know anything and this is not me admitting that I know nothing in order to like learn stuff or whatever that one philosopher said? No like, Im just dumb, I dont know anything. Once, when I was very lost, I asked my friend: Tell me something that makes sense. My friend was unable to do so. Could have been for many reasons but mostly I think its because nothing makes sense. I dont know what any bands best song is. I have been listening to the same 2000 songs for the past 5 years. I like to stare at the fire.

        <h2>LIVE ACTION BOOGERHEADS</h2></h2>
        <time>September 27, 2025</time>
        <p> 
			I am working on creating LEROY, but in real life. It is a helmet/head that will be worn, for a film / video I suppose. BOOGERHEADS (now in 3D) is a concept thats been brewing for around 2 or 3 years now. When I first thought about boogerheads, I could never decide on a medium, and still cant. I wanted it to be stop motion, live action, comics, animated, and more. Itll come around someday, I figured. Looking at Leroys head is almost surreal. This character that keeps appearing in my comic is suddenly off the page, and looking at me. We've been talking. More soon, Ill upload images eventually.

        <h2>go west game</h2>
        <time>September 13, 2025</time>
        <p> The rules are as follows: <p>
			1. Go west <p>
			2. If you cant go west (or it is more convienent to go in another direction) choose another direction to go in, preferably north or south, until going west is a viable option again.<p>
			3. When you turn around and go back, you lose.<p>

        <h2>Introduction/test post</h2>
        <time>September 9, 2025</time>
        <p>
          Hello. This page will likely be filled with ramblings and offputting streams of consciousness, or maybe something really REALLY cool? LITERALLY NO ONE KNOWS!
        </p>
        <img src="images/blog1.gif" alt="Example Image">
        <p>
	I'm creating this because sometimes I want to share things, or archive them, but... publicly? Like I could access them from any device, and you could too, but, still its not so public that lots of people will see this, Im sure just a few. I DONT KNOW, ITS A BLOG I GUESS? Pretentious as always, thinking my thoughts are worth posting online? Well, I dont really think they're worth anything, and I dont care if not a soul sees it. I like my creations living in a dark corner on the internet. Not because its edgy, but because its antisocial, and probably thinks it should've never been born. I dont know though, this is all a guess, go ask it for yourself.

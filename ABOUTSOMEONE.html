    <p>                               Hello, I am the creator, or... founder of some of this stuff. Not 'founded' like a ceo, but 'found' as in I discovered or came across these things, and something compelled me to pick them up. I found them in the deep recesses and crevices of my mind, wandering around the infinite streets at night, and somewhere inside my vomit. This page is ABOUT SOMEONE and I thinks its supposed to be about me. I am 21 years old at the time of writing this. I currently live in Pittsburgh PA. I dont know... what do you want to know about me? What is worth sharing? CONTACT ME HERE AND LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK: reappearingooze@protonmail.me</p>
